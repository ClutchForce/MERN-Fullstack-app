    <ul id="policy-list">
        <li>This policy outlines the process for addressing claims of copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</li>
        <li>If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: a description of the copyrighted work, a description of the infringing material, your contact information, and a statement of good faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized.</li>
        <li>A notice of infringement should be sent to the designated agent as specified in our contact details.</li>
        <li>Upon receipt of a valid infringement notice, we will promptly remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content and notify the content provider or user.</li>
        <li>Content providers or users may submit a counter-notice if they believe the content was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification. Counter-notices must include a statement under penalty of perjury that the content provider or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.</li>
        <li>Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice, we will promptly provide the original complaining party with a copy of the counter-notice and inform them that we may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.</li>
        <li>If the complaining party does not seek a court order against the content provider or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, within 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our discretion.</li>
